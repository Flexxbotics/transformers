# Transformers

This repository is home to open-source transformers that are compatible with **FlexxCore** within the Flexxbotics platform. Things you can find in this repository include:

- Two examples of equipment transformers (**Universal Robot** and **Haas NextGen Control CNC**).
- A base **Template** for creating your own transformer.
- An example of creating a **Workcell Transformer**, which embeds multiple transformers to:
  - Reconcile workcell state
  - Perform automatic restarts
  - Run threaded controls
  - Provide many more advanced capabilities
- An example of creating a **Script** that is callable from the Flexxbotics HMI Controls Configurator which can communicate with transformers.
