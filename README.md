# Flexxbotics Transformers

This repository is home to **open-source transformers** that are compatible with **FlexxCore** within the **Flexxbotics platform**.

Flexxbotics Transformers are connector drivers that enable interoperable compatibility with a wide range of industrial protocols, supporting data exchange via both open standards and proprietary interfaces.

## Overview

- Load transformers into the Flexxbotics software runtime to operate
- New connector drivers interoperate **many-to-many** across all endpoints
- Every new transformer you create and add is automatically compatible with all others loaded
- Use your Python IDE of choice to create new transformers

## What You’ll Find in This Repository

- Open source equipment transformers for use with Flexxbotics software
- Example of a base **Transformer Template** for creating your own transformer
- Example of a **Workcell Transformer**, which embeds multiple transformers to:
  - Reconcile workcell state  
  - Perform automatic restarts  
  - Run threaded controls  
  - Provide many additional advanced capabilities
- Example an **Automation Script** callable from the Flexxbotics HMI Controls Configurator or run in realtime that can communicate with transformers to perform automation tasks.

## What You Can Do

- Connect machines to robots and other automation
- Create multi-machine automation cells
- Program your own machine-to-automation transformers
- Get, use, modify, and redistribute transformers
